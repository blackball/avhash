avhash

This would probably be called similarity hashing by other people.
And I still can not recall why I named this piece of codes "avhash", 
"average hashing" ? probably because I use the average value to generate 
the bit vector (feature). It's a kind of like LBP, but I don't think it 
is the good way now. So what else ?

It's really simple, and an image matching demo was given. There's 
some further improvement would be pushed in, like make it image size adaptive. 

The hamming distance is really trival to me, how does it handle rotation problem ? 
Maybe in next push, I will do something related.
